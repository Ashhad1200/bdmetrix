# DBMatrix Logo Update Instructions

The following logo files need to be updated to reflect the new DBMatrix branding:

1. /public/images/logo/dbmatrix.png - Replace with DBMatrix dark logo
2. /public/images/logo/logo-white.svg - Replace with DBMatrix white logo

Current files are still using the original template logos and should be replaced with actual DBMatrix branded logos.

The logo components are already configured to use these files:

- HeaderLogo component: Uses dbmatrix.png
- Footer component: Uses dbmatrix.png

No code changes needed - just replace the SVG files with DBMatrix branded versions.
